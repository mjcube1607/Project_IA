**Information Assurance Project**

Objectives:
We were asked to design a security security solution for a company which lacked basic infrastructure security. We were asked to document and report all the recommended changes with a viable support to the changes.

Conclusion:
We provided a detailed design and architecture security solution. Made sure that the company was compliant against industry standards w.r.t data handling. All the solution proposed was done within a budget constraint.
